# I hope you now know about the data I am using for the online payment fraud detection task. Now in the section below, I’ll explain how we can use machine learning to detect online payment fraud using Python.

# I will start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset we need for this task:


# So this dataset does not have any null values. Before moving forward, now, let’s have a look at the type of transaction mentioned in the dataset

# Now let’s have a look at the correlation between the features of the data with the isFraud column:

# Now let’s transform the categorical features into numerical. Here I will also transform the values of the isFraud column into No Fraud and Fraud labels to have a better understanding of the output:


# Now let’s train a classification model to classify fraud and non-fraud transactions. Before training the model, I will split the data into training and test sets:

# Now let’s train the online payments fraud detection model:

# Now let’s classify whether a transaction is a fraud or not by feeding about a transaction into the model:

# Summary
## So this is how we can detect online payments fraud with machine learning using Python. Detecting online payment frauds is one of the applications of data science in finance. I hope you liked this article on online payments fraud detection with machine learning using Python.
